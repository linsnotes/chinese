# Chinese Textbook Words
A simple web application to fetch and filter word lists from Singapore Chinese textbooks (华文伴我行).

Users can search for word lists based on banding (HCL, G3, G2, G1), level, unit, and passage, providing a practical resource for educators and students.

The project utilises a Google Apps Script backend to retrieve data from Google Sheets and includes an interactive HTML frontend hosted on GitHub Pages.
